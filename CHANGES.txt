v1.3.3
  * New Debian package layout.
  * Fix package build.
v1.3.2
   * Improvemenys in Ldoc documentation.
   * Debianization.
v1.3.1
   * New ldoc documentation generated. Fixes in benchmark. Added
     benchmark to README.
v1.3.0:
   * New test suite using Busted. Improved documentation and some
     code.
v1.2.1:
   * Return to comparing strings by ==, and added case for when
     pattern is a closure instead. This is more predictable, and
     removes a bunch of indexing special cases. Also added utility
     function tamale.P, which converts a string literal to a pattern
     string matcher (i.e., P"num %d+").
   * Added "partial" row flag and special V"..." variable for
     allowing/capturing extra value fields not present in the row
     pattern.
   * Thanks to David Manura, Javier Guerra Giraldez, and Steve Donovan
     for feedback.
v1.2:
   * Added substitution for variables in result pattern, if any.
   * Changed "where" row hook to "when", to match Erlang. (oops)
   * Added check to block matching when value table had extra fields
     missing in pattern table.
   * Made strings compare by == unless pattern characters were
     present, then string.match is used (with captures). (This was
     probably a bad idea, as it's likely to cause unexpected bugs.)
   * Added explicit version number and rockspec.
   * Added several tests.

v1.1:
   * Sped up unification by saving ignore flag for variables at
     creation, than rechecking names at runtime.
   * Added ids option, to mark sentinel values which should still be
     compared by value rather than structure.
   * Removed "fail" hook for spec table, since it's functionally
     equivalent to adding a final row of { V"_", failure_handler }.
   * Added several tests, bugfixes, etc. (Thanks to Steve Donovan for
     early feedback.)

v1.0:
   * Initial release.
